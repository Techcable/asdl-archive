The old register allocator is in the file: 

    ra.sml 

The new register allocator is in the files: 

    ra-core.sig ra-core.sml ra-graph.sig ra-graph.sml
    ra-iteratedCoalescing.sml

    This is basically the old register allocator rearranged a bit,
    with various localized data structure changes.

The newest register allocator is in the files: 

    ra-priqueue.sig
    ra-flowgraph.sig
    new-ra-core.sig
    new-ra-core.sml
    new-ra-graph.sig
    new-ra-graph.sml
    new-ra-spill.sig
    new-ra-spill.sml
    cluster-ra.sml
    cfg-ra.sml
    ssa-ra.sml
    new-ra-params.sig
    new-ra.sig
    new-ra.sml

    This is a completely new implementation of the iterated coalescing
    algorithm.  With various algorithmic improvement.
