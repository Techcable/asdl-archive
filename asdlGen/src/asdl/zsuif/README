This is a preliminary SUIF to ZSUIF translator, it builds a
SUIF 2.0 backend pass the converts a SUIF 2.0 file into a ZSUIF pickle
suitable for browsing. It compiles and builds under the latest SUIF
2.0 alpha version (basesuif-2.0.0.alpha.720) and
suifversion1support-1.0.0.alpha.60. 

It builds cleanly under Solaris 2.5.1 using the SunPro compiler. To
get everything to link properly you need to reinstall libcii.a and
libasdl.a compiled with position independent code. Do the following 
	
 % cd src/c 
 % make clean

if using the native cc
 % make CFLAGS="-KPIC" 
or if using gcc
 % make CFLAGS="-fPIC" 

 % make install

After this you need to set up the SUIF 2.0 environment variables
correctly and set ASDL_HOME to the base install directory of
asdlGen. Then

 % cd src/asdl/zsuif
 % make install

should install the SUIF 2.0 pass do_zsuif gateway in the appropriate place.
