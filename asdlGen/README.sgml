<title>README for &asdlGen; version &asdlGen.version;
<author>&author.danwang;
<date>&asdlGen.release-date;
<p>
This is the third public release of &asdlGen;. It is still missing a few
important library functions to handle floating point numbers. This release
contains bug fixes an some incompatible changes in the way &asdlGen; handles
command line arguments. New features include:
<itemize>

<item> Command line arguments now conform the the GNU long option standards
and require an "=" between the argument and value. POSIX short options are
available for many common flags. See the Reference manual for details.

<item> The Java and C++ code can use a different list implementation.
  The Java and C++ back ends now can optionally produce tree walker classes
  and shallow and deep copy methods. 
  <em>Unfortunately, the deep copy method on lists does not
  not perform the deep copy correctly.</em>

<item> A preliminary ASDL specification of the
  <url url="&url.suif;" name="SUIF 2.0"> IR. A working prototype 
  translator between the SUIF 2.0 and <url url="&url.zsuif;" name="ZSUIF">
  is also provided.  This is included to elicit comments from developers 
  who are interested in a SUIF 2.0 interface.
<item>
 The HTML dump of pickles now uses a fancier HTML table layout by
 default. The old HTML list format is still available see the Reference
 Manual for details.

<sect>Documentation<p>
There is now a reference manual available in 
<url url="doc/html/manual.html" name="HTML"> and
<url url="doc/manual.ps/" name="Postscript">. A step by step tutorial is
in the works. 

<sect>Using zsuif.asdl<p> 
This distribution comes with a preliminary <url url="&url.suif;"
name="SUIF 2.0"> specification in <tt><url url="src/asdl/zsuif/"></tt>.  To
generate and compile the code along with the SUIF to ZSUIF translator see 
the README. 

<sect>Questions Comments?<p>
Questions and comments should be directed to

Zephyr Project see <url url="&url.zephyr;"> For the latest information
about ASDL see <url url="&url.asdlGen">

For applications that wish to manipulate generic ASDL values there are
various language specific libraries that take the type environment produced
by the --typ option and are able to manipulate the generic values.  An
example of this can be found in <htmlurl url="src/c/" name="src/c/xlate.c">, 
and <htmlurl url="src/sml/pp-pickle" name="src/sml/pp-pickle.sml">, which
depend on the ASDL descriptions found in src/asdl/generic.asdl.

<sect>TODO<p>
<itemize>
<item> Floating point support
<item> Get deep copy methods working for sequences in C++ and Java.
<item> In the not too distant future, pickle files will come stamped with a
magic number that identifies the type environment from which it was
generated. If the type environments are not exactly the same. The code will
complain. Right now the pickle code generates untyped pickles. So if you
feed it a pickle that is of the wrong type it will break.  

<item> None of the translators warn you when it has to mangle and
identifier to avoid using a reserved keyword.
<item> The pretty printing rules could be tweaked. 
<item> The handling of primitive types is more ad hoc than I'd like.
