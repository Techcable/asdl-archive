<title>README for &asdlGen; version &asdlGen.version;
<author>&author.danwang;
<date>&asdlGen.release-date;
<p>
This is a very alpha relase of the most latest version of &asdlGen;. Many of
the internals have been significantly reworked, and most of the major
internal interfaces have been documented. Consider it as a work in
progress. The build system is completely broken, so you'll need to build
things by hand. For the ML code this isn't any more painful than typing 
<tt>CM.make()</tt> in <tt>src/sml/</tt>. Major features include
<p>
Only the SML and C backends are working everything else is stuck
in various different states of disrepair. I'm pushing this relase out mainly
to get some feedback, and to let people get a feel of what's going on.
<itemize>
<item><tt>src/sml/convert</tt>Quick and dirty converters from SML and class
hierarchies to ASDL specifications.

<item>New syntax for importing modules
<code>
module T (imports VeryLongModuleName alias M) {
 foo = (M.t)
}
</code>
<item>Very preliminary support for XML.
<item>Support for user defined primitives. Rather than hard coding
information about user primitive types into &asdlGen; primtives are now
extensible. In particular the old primitive types of <tt/int/, <tt/string/,
<tt/identifier/. Are implemented by pre-appending the following declaration
to all inputs
<code>
primitive module StdPrims {
 int string identifier
}
</code>
&asdlGen; tacks this on to any set of input files to remain compatible with
existing code. Users, can add there own primitive types by simply including
there own primtive module declaration.
<item>Reworked simplified interface to primitve types.
<item>SML code now splits type definitions from pickle code. I've gotten
rid of all the <tt/open/ and <tt/include/s and stuck to fully qualified
identifiers in all the code.
