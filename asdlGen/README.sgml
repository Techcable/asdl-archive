<title>README for &asdlGen; version &asdlGen.version;
<author>&author.danwang;
<date>&asdlGen.release-date;
<p>
This is an alpha release of the most latest version of &asdlGen;. Many of
the internals have been significantly reworked, and most of the major
internal interfaces have been documented. Consider it as a work in
progress. The build system is now limping along. C and C++ code gets built
automatically on most Unix platforms. In the top-level directory
<code>
% ./configure --prefix=<em/install-prefix/
% make all
</code>
will do something sensible. Currently it just builds the needed libraries
and dumps a heap for asdlGen in <tt>src/sml/</tt>. The install rules will
change in the future. It currently doesn't produce any standalone
executables.

Major features include
<p>
<itemize>
<item>
SML, C, C++, Java, Haskell, and Icon backends are now working, but untested.
The Haskell, backend produces code that at leasts parses against
<tt>Hugs98</tt> but doesn't use labeled records as I was having problems
with field mangling.

<item><tt>src/sml/convert</tt>Quick and dirty converters from SML and class
hierarchies to ASDL specifications.

<item>New syntax for importing modules
<code>
module T (imports VeryLongModuleName alias M) {
 foo = (M.t)
}
</code>
<item>Very preliminary support for XML.
<item>Support for user defined primitives. Rather than hard coding
information about user primitive types into &asdlGen; primtives are now
extensible. In particular the old primitive types of <tt/int/, <tt/string/,
<tt/identifier/. Are implemented by pre-appending the following declaration
to all inputs
<code>
primitive module StdPrims {
 int string identifier
}
</code>
&asdlGen; tacks this on to any set of input files to remain compatible with
existing code. Users, can add there own primitive types by simply including
there own primtive module declaration.
<item>Reworked simplified interface to primitve types.
<item>SML code now splits type definitions from pickle code. I've gotten
rid of all the <tt/open/ and <tt/include/s and stuck to fully qualified
identifiers in all the code.
