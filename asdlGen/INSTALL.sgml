<title>INSTALL notes for &asdlGen; version &asdlGen.version;
<author>&author.danwang;
<date>&asdlGen.release-date;
<p>
The installation and build process is under going a major overhall, and
isn't complete yet. The only <tt/make/ file of any interest is the toplevel
one. It calls SML to build the system. The ML code to build various pieces
of the code are in <tt>src/sml/build/</tt>. The ML code determines certain
useful pieces of information about the current systesm (i.e. name of the C
compiler) using <tt/GNU autoconf/.
<code>
% ./configure --prefix=<em/install-prefix/
% make all
</code>
 See the internal documentation about the new build system and
<tt>src/sml/build</tt> for the uggly details.
