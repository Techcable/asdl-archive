<title>INSTALL notes for &asdlGen; version &asdlGen.version;
<author>&author.danwang;
<date>&asdlGen.release-date;
<p>
The installation and build process is under going a major overhall, and
isn't complete yet. You should ignore many of the <tt/make/ files as they
are going to go away. SML is now being used to build and install most of the
software. If you fire up SML/NJ and execute a <tt/CM.make()/ in the
<tt>src/sml/</tt> directory, you should get a system from which to dump a
heap. See the internal documentation about the new build system and
<tt>src/sml/build</tt> for the uggly details.
