<title>INSTALL notes for &asdlGen; version &asdlGen.version;
<author>&author.danwang;
<date>&asdlGen.release-date;

<p>These install notes aren't comprehensive feel free to send me email
<tt>danwang@cs.princeton.edu</tt> with questions and problems.

<sect>The Binary Distribution
<p>
Since installing the distribution from sources requires the SML/NJ compiler,
I'm providing a binary distribution for those who just want to use &asdlGen;
in a development environment that does not have SML/NJ installed. Fetch the
right binary version from 
<url url="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/zephyr/ASDL/&num;software">.

<sect1>Unix
<p> On a Unix system with ksh all you should have to do is unpack
the archive and put the shell script <htmlurl url="bin/asdlGen" name="">
bin/asdlGen in your path. If your stuck on a Unix system
without ksh you'll have to hack the script so it can locate the directory
where you unpacked the sources.

<sect1>Windows NT/95<p>
In a Windows environment you need to set the environment variable 
ASDL&lowbar;HOME to the location of where you unpacked the distribution. 
Also set your path to include <url url="bin/asdlGen.bat" 
name="bin/asdlGen.bat">. 

<sect>Installing from Sources<p> 

&asdlGen; now builds with <tt/autoconf/. To build from
sources you should have the latest version <url
url="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/working/110.0.2/"
name="110.0.2"> of <url
url="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/index.html" name="Standard ML
of New Jersey">. In the future, I plan to experiment with releasing sources
via a read only remote CVS repository.

<sect1>Unix
<p>
On a Unix machine run 
<tscreen>
./configure --prefix=<em>Your install prefix</em>
</tscreen>
let <tt/configure/ do it's thing, and do a <tt/make install/. Make install
will install most of the required supporting C, C++, and Java libraries
appropriately, and builds SML/NJ heap image. I'd suggest copying the heap to
<tscreen>
<em>your sml/nj directory</em>/bin/.heaps
</tscreen>
and making a symbolic link to the <tt>.run-it</tt> in the SML/NJ directory.
<sect1>Windows NT/95
<p>
I haven't figured out how to automatically compile the supporting Java, C,
and C++ libraries, but here are instructions on how to build the &asdlGen;
program itself.

On a Windows machine after sml-cm starts up in <tt>src/sml/</tt>.
