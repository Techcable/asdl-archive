<h1>The Binary Distribution</h1>
<p>
Since installing the distribution from sources requires the SML/NJ compiler,
I'm providing a binary distribution for those who just want to use asdlGen
in a development environment that does not have SML/NJ installed. Fetch the
right binary version from <a
href=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/zephyr/ASDL/#software>
<tt>http://www.cs.princeton.edu/zephyr/ASDL/#software</tt></a>.

<h2>Unix</h2> On a Unix system with ksh all you should have to do is unpack
the archive and put the shell script <a href=bin/asdlGen>
<tt>bin/asdlGen</tt></a> in your path. If your stuck on a Unix system
without ksh you'll have to hack the script so it can locate the directory
where you unpacked the sources.

<h2>Windows NT/95</h2>
In a Windows environment you need to set the environment variable 
ASDL_HOME to the location of where you unpacked the distribution. 
Also set your path to include <a href=bin/asdlGen.bat><tt>bin/asdlGen.bat</tt>
</a>. 

<h1>Installing from Sources</h1> 
To install from sources, you need to install the version 109.32 of the
SML/NJ compiler available as well as the SML/NJ Library. See <a
href=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/install.html>
<tt>http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/install.html</tt></a>for
details.

<h2>Unix</h2>
On a Unix machine cd into src/sml and run src/sml/build.sh to build a
working asdlGen from the sources. 
<h2>Windows NT/95</h2>
On a Windows machine cd into sing the Windows version invoke
src/sml/build.bat and type the following after <tt>sml-cm</tt> starts up.
<pre>
- CM.make();
... watch and wait while things compile
-  Export.export_it();
</pre>
<h2>Misc</h2>
In src/{c,cxx,java} there are example Makefiles that build some
applications and libraries using asdlGen. Doing a make install moves
the output into the appropriate directories.
